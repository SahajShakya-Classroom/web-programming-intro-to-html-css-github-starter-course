## Part 1: Class Routine using HTML and CSS
In this project, A web page presenting Class routine of 5th semester (section B)Computer engineering students studying in KEC was developed by using pure HTML and CSS.

A class routine was designed using HTML tables and styled using CSS. The table included days, time slots, subjects, labs and respected subject teacher's name. CSS properties such as borders, spacing, text alignment, background colors and font styles were applied to improve clear understanding.  

This project was specially made for the students to have a clear routine about their classes, timings and days. It demonstrates a simple format, easy for everyone to understand and presented neatly so that there is no any confusion or distractions while inspecting the Routine.
